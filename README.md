 ## Description

_Welcome to anotherTODO! This application was created with React using Typescript. I wanted a project on the easier side to learn how to use Typescript but I did not get what I bargained for. I had quite a few issues with dependencies and React 18. Only way I found past the issues was to use `npm install your-packages --legacy-peer-deps` I am currently unsure what this does (other than worked) and need to research it more._ 

This application:
* is currently deployed on [GH-Pages](https://amber-robeck.github.io/anotherTODO/ "Link to deployed page") 
* is just another todo app in the long quest of creating a million todo apps but this time using Typescript instead of plain Javascript. 
* users are currently able to ADD, EDIT, DELETE and MOVE a task.

Future development goals:
* Save tasks, probably local storage
* Strikethrough tasks when user moves to completed
* Make mobile responsive
